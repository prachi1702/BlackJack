# BlackJack
Black Jack game made in Python
How To Play-
You have two cards face up in front of your bet.
To play your hand, first you add the card values together and get a hand total anywhere from 4 to 21.
If you're dealt a ten-value card and an Ace as your first two cards that means you got a Blackjack!
